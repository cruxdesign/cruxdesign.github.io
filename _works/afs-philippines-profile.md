AFS is an international, volunteer-based, non-profit, non-governmental, non-religious organization that provides intercultural learning opportunities to help people develop the knowledge, skills and understanding needed to create a more just and peaceful world.

Crux produced this 5 minute treat that takes us through the years and around the world with AFS.
